              SQUDY is a deflationary utility token that powers our unique burn-to-win ecosystem. 
              Every campaign burns staked tokens, creating a continuous deflationary pressure that benefits all holders. 
              Our platform combines the excitement of lottery-style competitions with the economic benefits of token burning mechanisms.
