### 🎯 **Specific Audit Focus Areas**

#### **High Priority - Critical Functions**
1. **`stakeInCampaign()`**
   - Token transfer validation
   - Ticket calculation accuracy
   - Participant limit enforcement
   - Reentrancy protection

2. **`selectWinners()`**
   - Winner validation logic
   - Prize pool verification
   - Authorization checks
   - Event emission accuracy

3. **`burnCampaignTokens()`**
   - Fee calculation correctness
   - Token burning mechanism
   - State finalization
   - Platform fee distribution

#### **Medium Priority - State Management**
4. **Campaign Creation**
   - Parameter validation
   - Time boundary checks
   - Initial state setup

5. **Emergency Functions**
   - Withdrawal conditions
   - Admin override capabilities
   - Pause/unpause mechanics

### 🔒 **Known Security Considerations**

#### **Addressed Vulnerabilities**
- ✅ Reentrancy attacks (ReentrancyGuard)
- ✅ Integer overflow/underflow (SafeMath)
- ✅ Access control issues (Ownable, modifiers)
- ✅ Token transfer failures (SafeERC20)
- ✅ Time manipulation (reasonable boundaries)

#### **Potential Risk Areas for Audit**
- 🔍 Random number generation for winner selection (external dependency)
- 🔍 Gas optimization in loops (participant arrays)
- 🔍 Front-running in stake operations
- 🔍 Economic attacks on ticket pricing
- 🔍 Campaign timing edge cases

### 📊 **Gas Optimization Analysis**

#### **Current Optimizations**
- Immutable token address
- Packed structs where possible
- Efficient mapping usage
- Event-based data retrieval

#### **Areas for Review**
- Loop iterations in winner selection
- Storage vs memory usage
- Redundant calculations

### 🧪 **Testing Coverage Requirements**

#### **Unit Tests Needed**
- [ ] Campaign creation edge cases
- [ ] Staking with various amounts
- [ ] Winner selection algorithms
- [ ] Token burning calculations
- [ ] Emergency scenarios
- [ ] Access control violations

#### **Integration Tests Needed**
- [ ] Full campaign lifecycle
- [ ] Multiple concurrent campaigns
- [ ] Large participant scenarios
- [ ] Fee calculation accuracy

#### **Stress Tests Needed**
- [ ] Maximum participants campaign
- [ ] Large token amounts
- [ ] Edge case timestamps
- [ ] Gas limit scenarios

### 💰 **Economic Model Validation**

#### **Fee Structure**
- Platform fee: 2.5% (250 basis points)
- Fee recipient: Configurable admin address
- Burning mechanism: Remaining tokens to dead address

#### **Economic Attacks to Consider**
- Sybil attacks with minimum stakes
- Prize pool manipulation
- Timing attacks around campaign periods
- Gas price manipulation
